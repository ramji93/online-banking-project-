my first java web application 
This online banking web application starts with a login page
User should enter username and password for his/her account
If they are wrong appropriate message will be shown else home page will be loaded
Home page will contain 5 options 1. Create new account 2. Transactions 3.Display account statements 4.Authorize credit card transactions 5.Log out
